                                               Clothing Sales Forecasting
I led a 'Clothing Sales Forecasting' project, combining expertise in time series analysis with the implementation of an ARIMA model. Leveraging my skills in Python, I generated a synthetic dataset to simulate realistic sales patterns. The ARIMA model proved instrumental in predicting future sales, considering the inherent seasonality and trends in the clothing industry. This project not only showcased my proficiency in advanced forecasting techniques but also demonstrated the ability to create synthetic data for robust model training and testing. The outcome was a reliable forecasting tool aiding in strategic inventory management and business decision-making.
